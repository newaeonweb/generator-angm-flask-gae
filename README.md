# Generator Angular Flask Google App Engine
---

This project is a mix of  [Google App Engine Angular Material Starter](https://github.com/madvas/gae-angular-material-starter)
And [Gnerator-angm](https://github.com/newaeonweb/generator-angm).

It's an easy starting point to develop dynamic application using the stack:

* Google App Engine
* Python Flask
* AngularJS
* Angular Material
* Gulp, Bower, npm

# Install

You must have the following things installed on your machine:
* [Google App Engine SDK for Python][]
* [Node.js][]
* [pip][]
* [virtualenv][]

> Note: If you have python installed with **homebrew**, you may experiment some issues to run some arguments
to install the dependencies on **virtualenv**.

#Work in progress
